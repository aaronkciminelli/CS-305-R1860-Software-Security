# CS-305-R1860-Software-Security

## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
## What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
## What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Artemis Financial is a fictitious consulting company that develops personalized financial plans for its clients. The company aimed to modernize its operations and add security to its web application to safeguard sensitive client data. Specifically, I was tasked with adding a file verification step using checksums to ensure secure data transfers. I carefully assessed potential vulnerabilities in the existing codebase and web application to provide a thorough solution. Software security is critical for businesses to safeguard their data, systems, and customers. As a developer, I must code securely and mitigate vulnerabilities. The vulnerability assessment helped me identify areas to refactor and improve. The main challenge was balancing added security with maintaining software functionality. I enhanced security by adding input validation, proper encryption, and the checksum verification requirement. I thoroughly tested the refactored code to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. I used static analysis tools, looked for common vulnerability patterns, and tested edge cases. In the future, I would utilize tools like static application security testing (SAST) to detect vulnerabilities automatically. I would also implement security testing earlier in the development lifecycle. My work demonstrates skills in secure coding, vulnerability testing, and delivering a functional, secure software solution that meets the client's needs. This project showcases my ability to improve legacy applications with secure coding principles, a valuable asset for any potential employer.
